I am an Assistant Professor at the [ECE department of McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/). 
My major research interests lie in software analysis, testing, and mining code repositories with a focus on Android applications, smart contracts and IoT software. 
I was a Post-doctoral Fellow in [CASTLE group](http://sccpu2.cse.ust.hk/castle/index.html) at HKUST, and a recipient of the [Postdoctoral Fellowship Award by the Hong Kong Research Grant Council](https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc/funding_opport/pdfs/). 
I completed my doctoral degree under the supervision of [Prof. S.C. Cheung](http://www.cse.ust.hk/faculty/scc/) at HKUST in Spring 2020. My doctoral thesis focuses on taming compatibility issues raised by Android fragmentation.

I visited Opera at UCSD from Feb 2019 to Aug 2019. It was a fruitful experience there with [Prof. Yuanyuan Zhou](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~yyzhou/) and the group members.

I obtained my B.Sc. degree in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Nanjing University (2011-2015).
