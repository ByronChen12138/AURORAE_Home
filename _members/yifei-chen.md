I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at McGill University. My research interests include player modeling, human mimicking agents, and application of machine learning and large language models in game analysis and testing. I received my B.Eng. degree in Computer Engineering from McGill University in 2019.
